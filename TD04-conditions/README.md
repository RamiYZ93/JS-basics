# TD04 - Conditional Statements (if / else & switch)

## Objective

Practice writing conditional logic in JavaScript using:

- `if / else if / else`
- Logical operators (`&&`)
- Comparison operators (`>=`, `<`)
- `switch` statements

## Part 1 – Age-Based Income Logic (if / else)

### Goal

Create a program that determines a person's source of income based on their age.

### Requirements

1. Declare a variable representing age.
2. Use conditional statements to determine:
   - If age is 65 or older → display a pension message.
   - If age is between 18 and 64 → display a salary message.
   - If age is under 18 → display an allowance message.
   - If the value is not valid → display an error message.
3. Test the program by modifying the age value.

### Concepts Practiced

- Variable declaration
- Conditional branching
- Logical AND operator (`&&`)
- Numeric comparisons

## Part 2 – Weekly Routine (switch statement)

### Goal

Create a program that determines an activity based on the day of the week.

### Requirements

1. Declare a variable representing a day (string).
2. Use a `switch` statement to handle:
   - Each day of the week (Monday → Sunday).
   - A specific activity for each day.
3. Include a `default` case for invalid values.
4. Add `break` statements after each case.

### Concepts Practiced

- Switch-case logic
- String comparison
- Default case handling
- Control flow structure

## Key Learning Points

- Structuring multiple conditions properly
- Avoiding logic errors with `>=` and `<`
- Using `&&` for combined conditions
- Understanding the difference between `if/else` and `switch`

---

## Goal

Develop a clear understanding of conditional logic and decision-making structures in JavaScript.
