# TD02 - JavaScript Operators

## Objective

Practice using JavaScript operators including:
- Assignment operators
- Arithmetic operators
- Comparison operators
- String concatenation
- Boolean logic
- Conditional evaluation

---

## Exercise 1 – Assignment Operators

- Declare two variables and assign them numeric values.
- Add the two values and store the result in a third variable.
- Display the result in the console.

---

## Exercise 2 – Arithmetic Operators

Perform and display the result of:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Modulus

---

## Exercise 3 – Comparison Operators

Check and display the result of:
- Greater than comparison
- Less than or equal comparison
- Difference between two values

---

## Exercise 4 – String Concatenation

- Create two string variables (first name and last name).
- Combine them using the concatenation operator.
- Display the final result.

---

## Exercise 5 – String Manipulation

- Create a sentence as a string.
- Replace part of the sentence.
- Display the updated string.

---

## Exercise 6 – Boolean Comparisons

Verify and display:
- Equality comparison
- Strict equality comparison
- Difference comparison

---

## Exercise 7 – Conditional Evaluation

- Create a variable representing age.
- Write a condition to check if the person is an adult.
- Display the appropriate message based on the result.

---

## Concepts Practiced

- Variable declaration
- Arithmetic operations
- Comparison operators
- String manipulation
- Boolean logic
- Conditional statements (`if / else`)
- Console output

---

## Goal

Strengthen understanding of fundamental JavaScript operators and logical evaluation.
